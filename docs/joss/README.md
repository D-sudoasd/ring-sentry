# RingSentry: JOSS submission preparation

Preparation record: 27 September 2026. This is a preparation candidate, not a submitted or accepted paper.

## Start here

- [Manuscript](../../paper/paper.md), [bibliography](../../paper/paper.bib).
- [Author, policy, and evidence record](submission-record.json).
- [Research-use record](research-use.md).
- [Validation instructions](validation.md).

The manuscript date is a **draft preparation date**. Set it to the actual submission day before sending. The software source version is 7.0.0; identify every tested and submitted candidate by its Git commit as well as version. Do not attach a historical archive DOI to this new source as an exact-version archive.

## Remaining author and time-dependent checks

1. Confirm the actual public-availability date from public releases, issue/PR records, or visibility records. Repository creation (2026-04-16) is not proof that it was public at creation. The conditional planning date 2026-10-17 assumes public availability from creation; later public availability moves the date later. Continue real maintenance driven by use and feedback. Automated runs and empty commits do not establish iteration.
2. Complete the historical revision, specific operations, and processing-record location in the research-use record. Keep private experimental inputs private; prepare an editor-visible explanation or permitted supporting records. Synthetic fixtures check software, not experimental adoption.
3. The sole author must review the final code, paper, figures and AI-assisted changes and confirm the updated disclosure. Earlier review of another package or version cannot cover these changes.
4. Refresh policy, repository status, installation, tests, examples, references, and the official PDF on the exact submission commit. Download CI artifacts before their retention period expires. Set the actual submission date and check the PDF again.
5. Submit the repository URL and `paper/paper.md` location through JOSS. Disclose the related Acta Materialia study and any additional related publications or submissions. The same research-use study can support several tools only with each tool's actual role distinguished.
6. After successful review, create the agreed version tag and immutable software archive, verify the version DOI, and report them in the review issue. Do not invent a JOSS paper DOI or mark this candidate accepted.

JOSS requires an OSI-approved license, more than six months of public development with substantive iteration, actual research use, and good open-source practices. External users are welcome but are not a universal numeric gate. No checklist can substitute for editorial scope assessment. Official sources, checked 2026-09-27: [submission](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html), [paper](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paper.html), [review](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html).

AI assistance in development and paper preparation must be disclosed. Under the policy checked above, AI use in author conversations with editors/reviewers is limited to translation; the author should write substantive responses personally.
